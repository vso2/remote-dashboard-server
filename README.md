# Remote Dashboard

API that runs the terminal session.

## Requirements

You'll need NodeJS installed in your machine and runs it on Linux. This project will start a bash session, it's not going to work if you try on Windows.


## To run it: 


Install the dependencies using  `npm i` then run it with `npm run dev`

It will initialize a shell session. 

## Troubleshooting

If the api doesn't start the bash session, go to shell/shell.js and change PATH to the right path to bash in your machine.
